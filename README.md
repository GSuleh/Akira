# Akira
First person shooter. HDRP project.

Akira is a third person shooter gaming whose objective is to eliminate all other enemies within the game scene before being terminated.

This is a subgenre of 3D shooter games in which the player character is visible on-screen during gaming, and the gameplay consists primarily of shooting.

There is a target UI on the game screen to help the player aim and shoot enemies in the game. 
The game also has a timer which counts down towards the end of the level. A player only wins by surviving the duration of the game and eliminating the enemy.
Do not be terminated before the end of the game or that counts as a loss. These make up the rules of the game.

Features within the game include character animation with reaction to game events such as being shot, running, jumping and dying animations.
There are sound effects for dying and shooting. The game also implements a camera follow functionality since it is a TPS game.
The game was made using the HDRP pipeline for high render graphics in a bid to make it more immersive as well as creating an ‘open world’ feel, though on a limited scope. Thus allowed for the introduction of real particle emissions such as dust and fog as well as muzzle sparks on firing bullets.
